            <p>
                Welcome to Jeanne's Crochet Corner! We are a 
                small business making 100% handcrafted items in 
                a variety of ways. Our products are the creative 
                culmination of years of practice and expertise, 
                going back for many years, and passed down 
                through generations. 

                The spirit of our business began as family gifts,
                a staple of holiday and birthday celebrations.
                Through the years, requests from friends and
                co-workers became commonplace. The success
                and volume of these requests led to yearly 
                appearances at local craft fairs. Now, we are 
                proud to officially be a full online business!

                At Jeanne's Crochet Corner, we feel that the
                crafter's spirit, attention to detail, and 
                creativity will always have a place in the 
                consumer market. Each product is unique, and
                we offer what you could never get at the 
                store.
